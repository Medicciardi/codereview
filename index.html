      <p>A little about me:</p>
      <p>I am 23 years old, and have studied at clackamas community college and receieved an associate's degree. my most recent job experience is with a furniture store called Ethan Allen. I was the warehouse manager there. I soon start a new job leasing apartments. I decided to enroll in Epicodus' evening intro course to enhance my understanding of code. I previously knew a little about css and html but I feel <strong>a lot</strong> better equipped already! When I'm not coding or working, I like to climb, snowboard, read, and hike. I <em>really</em> enjoy the outdoors.
